1950,1970,Software shared as public domain,"While not called ""open source"" at the time, researchers would collaborate on code and considered it communal knowledge",other,note,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-domain_software#Early_academic_public-domain_software_ecosystem,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Cc-public_domain_mark_white.svg/768px-Cc-public_domain_mark_white.svg.png,,"era,academia,culture,public domain"
1969,,ARPANET is created,"Created in 1969 and shut down in 1990, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was a network project that the United States agency ARPA (later known as DARPA) funded in 1966 with the goal of enabling communication and access to remote systems. An additional goal of ARPANET was to facilitate the distribution of software. ARPANET initially implemented the 1822 protocol, then switched to the Network Control Protocol (NCP), before transitioning to TCP/IP. ARPANET is generally considered to be one of the predecessors to the Internet.",release,critical,https://web.archive.org/web/20120915113839/http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2554,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arpanet_in_the_1970s.png#/media/File:Arpanet_in_the_1970s.png,,"ARPA,internet,network,government,tcp/ip,1822 protocol"
1974,1977,Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works recommended that software should be protected by copyright law,"The Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (or CONTU) was a three-year study on copyright in regards to computers and ""machine duplication systems"", with the goal of revising copyright laws in the United States. CONTU recommended that software be subject to copyright, with one dissention expressing that an executable program itself should not be copyrightable as it counts as a ""machine-control element"". The Computer Software Copyright Act of 1980 implemented much of CONTU's recommendations.",milestone,critical,https://repository.law.uic.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1573&context=jitpl,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CONTU_portrait_1978.jpg,,"copyright,United States,policy"
1980,1990,"Software and modifications are shared via Usenet, BBS networks, et al.","In the 1980s, users distributed software and source code to others on Usenet, online bulletin board systems (BBS), and other communities. While some of the software was distributed just so that it could be used, the 1980s also saw users modifying the software and subsequently sharing their modifications. Communities to discuss and collaborate on modifications emerged.",other,note,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_free_and_open-source_software#Online_software_sharing_communities_in_the_1980s,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Usenet_servers_and_clients.svg/522px-Usenet_servers_and_clients.svg.png,,"era,sharing,free software,grassroots,modification,communities"
1983,,Software copyright rises to the status of literary works,"In the case of Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corporation, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that computer software could be protected by copyright.

1984,,The MIT license is released,"After the establishment of software's copyrightability in the United States, researchers at the Computer Systems Research (CSR) group at MIT saw the need to place conditions around the distribution of network software that they had developed. As the goal of sharing the software was to steer the direction of technology, not to sell it, they drafted some initial text that added a permission notice to a copyright notice. This became known as the MIT License.",release,critical,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9263265,,,"license,MIT,legal,permissive"
1989,,The first version of the GPL is released,"In 1989, Richard Stallman created the GNU General Public License (GPL) in response to the commercialization of code that had previously been freely available.

1989-06,,The first BSD-style license is released,"While the first definitive 4-clause BSD license was published in 1990, its roots are present in its predecessor which accompanied the BSD-authored networking code included in 4.3BSD-Tahoe. This license primarily required that copyright notices be maintained and that products that redistributed it attribute the University of California et al. The first BSD License to conform to the open source definition (OSD) was the 3-clause license, sometimes referred to as ""BSD-new"", which was published in 1999.",release,medium,https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/kirkmck.html#:~:text=The%20licensing%20terms%20were%20liberal,,,"license,legal,BSD,free software"
1991-09-17,,Linux is released,"Linux started as a toy project of Linus Torvalds, who wanted an operating system that would could run on Intel's 80386 x86 microprocessor and was freely available, modifiable, and redistributable.
